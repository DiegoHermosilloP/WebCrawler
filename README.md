# WebCrawler
This code was made as a proyect in the "Recuperación de la información" course at Universidad de Cádiz by Diego Hermosillo.

It utilizes Scrapy library to create a web crawler to scrape wikipedia text. The parameters "allowed domains", "starting url" and the depth of the crawl are defined in the code and can be modified.
The scraped text is stored in json files.
